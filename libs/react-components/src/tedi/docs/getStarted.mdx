# Get started with TEHIK tedi-react

### Installation

```bash
npm install @tehik-ee/tedi-react
```

### Labels - LabelProvider

@tehik-ee/tedi-react uses labels that are provided with <b>{'<LabelProvider>'}</b> component. Every
application should be wrapped with LabelProvider to provide all necessary labels for users (mostly for
accessibility). See all labels under [Documentation/Labels](/docs/documentation-labels--docs).
More documentation about LabelProvider can be found under [components](/docs/components-labelprovider--docs).

#### 1. Wrap Application with LabelProvider

```tsx
<LabelProvider labels={labels} locale={locale}>
  <YourApp />
</LabelProvider>
```

### Styles - StyleProvider

tedi-react depends on some global styles. Follow next steps to import styles to your
application.

#### 1. Wrap Application with StyleProvider

```tsx
<StyleProvider>
  <YourApp />
</StyleProvider>
```

#### 2. Add styles import to the root of application

```tsx
import '@tehik-ee/tedi-react/index.css';
```

#### 3. If u are not using Layout component u should wrap your application with AccessibilityProvider

It provides some global functionality for accessibility. For example Skeleton accessibilty texts and initializes what-input library.

```tsx
<AccessibilityProvider>
  <YourApp />
</AccessibilityProvider>
```

### Dayjs

Some tedi-react components depend on Day.js and MUI X.
Day.js must be an application dependency, so it's recommended to use it for handling dates.

The <code>'en'</code> locale has a modified rule that sets weekStart to Monday. Currently, overriding this rule is not supported.
If you need to override it, please reach out on Slack.

### Server-side-rendering

When using SSR, you have option to pass defaultServerBreakpoint prop to every component that uses [BreakpointProps](/docs/helpers-usebreakpointprops--usebreakpointprops).
This creates a possibility to tell in which breakpoint the component should be rendered on the server to avoid layout shifts.
