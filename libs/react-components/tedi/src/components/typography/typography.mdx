### Text

Text is a helper component used to apply different colors and modifiers to text.
Modifiers prop accepts array of modifiers or single modifier. It helps you to combine modifiers if needed.
Every modifier and color of text also has its own global CSS class, but using the Text component is recommended.

Basic usage:

```jsx
<Text element="h1" modifiers="capitalize" color="primary">
  Some text
</Text>
```

Multiple modifiers:

```jsx
<Text color="tertiary" modifiers={['bold', 'uppercase']}>
  Some text
</Text>
```

You can also use:

```jsx
<h1>Some text</h1>
```

You can also use TEDI classes, such as::

```jsx
<p class="tedi-text--disabled">Some text</p>
```

### Heading

This component is a wrapper around the `<Text>` component. It should only be used when we want to semantically render h1-h6 tags.
The same result can be achieved by using `<Text element="h1">`, but using this component provides a better indicator in code that we are using semantic headings.

<strong>NB!</strong> Headings have dynamic font styles, which means that they have different font-size/font-weight/line-height
values for desktop/mobile.

Basic usage:

```jsx
<Heading element="h2">Some heading</Heading>
```

### Breakpoint support

You can use breakpoint props to render modifiers, colors, or even elements differently based on different breakpoints. Simply pass an object as a prop
corresponding to the desired breakpoint. Each object can contain any combination of `modifiers` and `color` to adjust the text styling.

Breakpoints available: `sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `xxl`

Basic usage:

```jsx
<Text element="span" modifiers="uppercase" sm={{ modifiers: 'small', color: 'primary' }}>
  Responsive Text
</Text>
```

```jsx
<Heading element="h1" modifiers="uppercase" md={{ modifiers: 'lowercase' }}>
  Responsive Heading
</Heading>
```
