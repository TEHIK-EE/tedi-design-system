# Color Tokens

The same design tokens are used for Figma and development. For more detailed info look at [guidelines](/docs/documentation-colors-guidelines--colors-guidelines) below.

Tokens are semantically named. Semantically incorrect uses are generally not tolerated, only in some rare
usecases. This means that the developer should not, for example, use the border color as the background
color. The tokens are divided into groups, which are described below.

Component library also export some helper functions for colors usage, which can be found under [Text component](/docs/components-typography-text--docs)
and [Background-colors](/docs/helpers-background-colors--docs)
